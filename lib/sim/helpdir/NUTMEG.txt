TEXT:      The label entry facilities are very primitive - after all,
TEXT: H     Gnutmeg Hisn't a graphics editor (yet).  You must be careful
TEXT: H     to type very slowly when entering labels -- Gnutmeg Hchecks
TEXT: H     the GX Hevent queue once every second, and can get very con-
TEXT: H     fused if characters arrive faster than that.
TEXT: H
TEXT:      When defining aliases like
TEXT: H
TEXT:           Galias Hpdb Gplot dbH( '!:1' - '!:2' )
TEXT: H
TEXT:      you must be careful to quote the argument list substitutions
TEXT: H     in this manner. If you quote the whole argument it might not
TEXT: H     work properly.
TEXT: H
TEXT:      In a user-defined function, the arguments cannot be part of
TEXT: H     a name that uses the _p_l_o_t._v_e_c syntax.  I.e,
TEXT: H
TEXT:           Gdefine Hpoke(duck) GcosH(tran1.duck)
TEXT: H
TEXT:      won't do the right thing.
TEXT: H
TEXT:      If you type Gplot all allH, or otherwise use a wildcard refer-
TEXT: H     ence for one plot twice in a command, bad things will hap-
TEXT: H     pen.
TEXT: H
TEXT:      The Gasciiplot Hcommand doesn't deal with log scales or most
TEXT: H     of the keywords that Gplot Hrecognises.  Don't expect it to
TEXT: H     ever do smith charts.
TEXT: H
TEXT:      When a new vector is created with the G[ ] Hand G[[ ]] Hopera-
TEXT: H     tions, a subset of the old scale should also be created for
TEXT: H     it that includes the same elements, so that it may be plot-
TEXT: H     ted, etc.
TEXT: H
TEXT:      When substitutions are done with the ^_o_l_d^_n_e_w^ syntax, there
TEXT: H     may be no spaces in either _o_l_d or _n_e_w.
TEXT: H
TEXT:      If the user erases text in an X plot window by typing spaces
TEXT: H     over it, and then dumps it to a file with the Ghardcopy Hcom-
TEXT: H     mand, the erased text will re-appear.
TEXT: H
TEXT:      If an X plot window is created and then resized to be much
TEXT: H     larger, or the Ghardcopy Hcommand is used to dump it to a file
TEXT: H     and it is then printed on a device with much higher resolu-
TEXT: H     tion than the X display, the "automatic manhattanization"
TEXT: H     feature (i.e, round-off error) will cause the picture to
TEXT: H     look very funny.
TEXT: H
TEXT:      SPICE3 will recognise all the notations used in SPICE2 G.plot
TEXT: H     Hcards, and will translate Gvp(1) Hinto Gph(v(1))H, and so forth.
TEXT: H     However, if there are spaces in these names it won't work.
TEXT: H     Hence Gv(1, 2) Hand G(-.5, .5) Haren't recognised.
TEXT: H
TEXT:      The "nutmeg programming language" should serve as a lesson
TEXT: H     on why a language designer should understand that he is
TEXT: H     creating a language before he has already implemented it.
TEXT: H
TEXT:      If a command is implemented as a script, the Ghelp Hcommand
TEXT: H     won't say anything about it and it won't be available for
TEXT: H     command and argument completion.
TEXT: H
TEXT:      If you plot an expression containing the function GrndH, and
TEXT: H     then zoom in or out in the window, you will get different
TEXT: H     random numbers in the new window.
TEXT: H
TEXT:      Global filename expansion has some problems.  In particular,
TEXT: H     G*/* Hmay give a result of "No match" when there is a file in

SUBJECT: caveats
TITLE: Caveats
TEXT: 
TEXT:      Often the names of terminals recognised by GMFB Hare different
TEXT: H     from those in /etc/termcap. Thus you may have to reset your
TEXT: H     terminal type with the command
TEXT: H
TEXT:           Gset Hterm = _t_e_r_m_n_a_m_e
TEXT: H
TEXT:      where _t_e_r_m_n_a_m_e is the name in the Gmfbcap Hfile.
TEXT: H
TEXT:      The Ghardcopy Hcommand is useless on VMS and other systems
TEXT: H     without the UNIX Gplot Hcommand, unless the user has a program
TEXT: H     that understands _p_l_o_t(_5) format.
TEXT: H
TEXT:      GSpice Hinput files specified on the command line are read in
TEXT: H     before theG.spiceinit Hfile is read. Thus if you define
TEXT: H     aliases there that you call in a Gspice Hsource file mentioned
TEXT: H     on the command line, they won't be recognised.
TEXT: H
TEXT:      If you interrupt a simulation and then load in a new deck,
TEXT: H     or Gsetcirc Hto a different one, and run a simulation on that,
TEXT: H     it will not be possible to Gresume Hthe old simulation.

SUBJECT: commands
TITLE: Built-in Commands
TEXT: 
TEXT:      When a command is typed, it is interpreted as one of several
TEXT: H     things.  First, it may be an alias, in which case the line
TEXT: H     is replaced with the result after alias substitution, and
TEXT: H     the line is re-parsed.  Second, it may be a pre-defined com-
TEXT: H     mand, in which case it is executed (see below for a list of
TEXT: H     available commands).  Third, it may be the name of a circuit
TEXT: H     file, in which case it is loaded (if the program is GspiceH)
TEXT: H     as if with a Gsource Hcommand.  Fourth, it may be the name of
TEXT: H     a command script - Gnutmeg Hsearches the current Gsourcepath
TEXT: H     Hfor the file and executes it when it is found.  The effect
TEXT: H     of this is identical to the effect of Gsouce fileH, except
TEXT: H     that the variables Gargc Hand Gargv Hare set.  Fifth, it may be
TEXT: H     an assignment statement, which consists of a vector name, an
TEXT: H     G= Hsymbol, and an expression (see the syntax for the Glet Hcom-
TEXT: H     mand), in which case it is executed as if it were preceeded
TEXT: H     by the word GletH.  Finally, it may be a UNIX command, in
TEXT: H     which case if the variable Gunixcom His set, it is executed as
TEXT: H     though it were typed to the shell.  (This is only available
TEXT: H     on BSD UNIX systems.)
TEXT: H
TEXT:      The following is a list of the built-in commands available.
TEXT: H     Some may be command scripts - the only difference between a
TEXT: H     built-in and a script that is visible to the user is that a
TEXT: H     script will not be mentioned in the quick help summary, and
TEXT: H     will not be visible to command completion.

TEXT: H     which case the appropriate arguments are substituted in.  If
TEXT: H     there are no such references, any arguments given are

TEXT: H
TEXT:      In the body if the alias text, any strings of the form

TEXT: H     with the Galias Hcommand, these strings must be quoted to
TEXT: H     prevent history substitution from replacing the G!H's before
TEXT: H     the Galias Hcommand can get to them.

TITLE: Quoting
TEXT: 
TEXT:      Words may be quoted with the characters " (double quote), '
TEXT: H     (single quote), and ` (back quote).   A word enclosed by any
TEXT: H     of these quotes may contain white space.  A string enclosed
TEXT: H     by double quotes may have further special-character substi-
TEXT: H     tutions done on it, but it will be considered one word by
TEXT: H     the program.  A number so quoted is considered a string.  A
TEXT: H     string enclosed by single quotes also has all its special
TEXT: H     characters protected.  Thus no glob expansion (*, ?, etc),
TEXT: H     variable expansion ($), or history substitution (^, !) will
TEXT: H     be done.  Numbers are still considered numbers though.  A
TEXT: H     string enclosed by backquotes is considered a command to the
TEXT: H     shell and is executed, and the output of the command
TEXT: H     repalaces the text.  Obviously the command should not gen-

TEXT: H     special variables $$ and $< refer to the process ID of the
TEXT: H     program and a line of input which is read from the terminal
TEXT: H     when the variable is evaluated, respectively.  If a variable
TEXT: H     has a name of the form $&_w_o_r_d, then _w_o_r_d is considered a
TEXT: H     vector, and its value is taken to be the value of the vari-
TEXT: H     able.  If $_f_o_o is a valid variable, and is of type GlistH,
TEXT: H     then the expression $_f_o_o[_l_o_w-_h_i_g_h] represents a range of

TEXT: H     out, and the reverse of a list may be obtained with
TEXT: H     $_f_o_o[_l_e_n-_0].  Also, the notation $?_f_o_o evaluates to 1 if the

TITLE: X
TEXT:

TEXT: H     is opened.  If the variable Gmaxwins His set and there are
TEXT: H     already that many plot windows available, the oldest one is
TEXT: H     re-used.  If the window being opened is the _nth window, and
TEXT: H     the variable GgeometryH_n is defined, then this string is used
TEXT: H     as the window's geometry (see the X documentation for a
TEXT: H     description of geometry specifications).  Otherwise the user
TEXT: H     is prompted for the window's size and position: as usual,
TEXT: H     the left button will create the window with the default size
TEXT: H     and position, the middle button allows the user to drag the
TEXT: H     window open, and the right button allows the user to create
TEXT: H     a window of the default size at any location.  The defaults
TEXT: H     are such that the window will be 1/3 the height and width of
TEXT: H     the screen, positioned in the center.
TEXT: H
TEXT:      After the window is created and the data is plotted, the
TEXT: H     buttons have various functions.  The left button causes a
TEXT: H     new plot command to be issued, with the limits on the x- and
TEXT: H     y-axis roughly 4 times the size of those in the first window
TEXT: H     (i.e, zoom out).  The middle button causes the window to
TEXT: H     disappear.  The right button allows the user to drag open a
TEXT: H     box (or circle), and then creates a new window which zooms
TEXT: H     in on this area.
TEXT: H
TEXT:      If the cursor is positioned in a plot window and characters
TEXT: H     are typed on the keyboard, they will appear as text in the
TEXT: H     window in the same font as the other text.  The cursor will
TEXT: H     move to the right as text is added, but due to the way X
TEXT: H     windows are handled by GnutmegH, text must be typed slowly so
TEXT: H     the cursor can keep up with it.  This allows one to add text
TEXT: H     to a window or remove it with spaces before sending it to a
TEXT: H     printer with a window-dump program.
TEXT: H
TEXT:      If a Ghardcopy Hcommand with no expressions is given, the user
TEXT: H     will be prompted to select a window which will be dumped

TEXT:                Each element in the circuit is specified by an  element
TEXT: H          line  that  contains  the element name, the circuit nodes to

TEXT: H          eters  that  determine the electrical characteristics of the
TEXT: H          element.  The first letter of the element name specifies the
TEXT: H          element  type.   The  format  for the SPICE element types is
TEXT: H          given in what follows.  The strings  XXXXXXX,  YYYYYYY,  and
TEXT: H          ZZZZZZZ denote arbitrary alphanumeric strings.  For example,
TEXT: H          a resistor name must begin with the letter `R' and can  con-
TEXT: H          tain  one  or more characters.  Hence, R, R1, RSE, ROUT, and

TEXT: H          such as that shown here will make the input easier to under-
TEXT: H          stand.   With respect to branch voltages and currents, SPICE
TEXT: H          uniformly uses the associated reference convention  (current
TEXT: H          flows in the direction of voltage drop).
TEXT: H
TEXT:                Nodes names may be arbitrary  character  strings.   The
TEXT: H          datum  (ground)  node must be named '0'.  The circuit cannot
TEXT: H          contain a loop of voltage sources and/or inductors and  can-
TEXT: H          not  contain  a cutset of current sources and/or capacitors.
TEXT: H          Each node in the circuit must have  a  dc  path  to  ground.
TEXT: H          Every  node  must  have  at least two connections except for

TEXT:                This line is for setting transient initial  conditions.
TEXT: H          It  has  two different interpretations, depending on whether
TEXT: H          the GUIC Hparameter is specified on the G.TRAN Hline.  Also, one
TEXT: H          should  not  confuse  this line with the G.NODESET Hline.  The
TEXT: H          G.NODESET Hline is only to help dc convergence, and  does  not
TEXT: H          affect  final  bias  solution  (except for multi-stable cir-
TEXT: H          cuits).  The two interpretations of this line  are  as  fol-
TEXT: H          lows:
TEXT: H
TEXT:           1.   When the GUIC Hparameter is specified on the G.TRAN  Hline,
TEXT: H               then  the  node  voltages specified on the G.IC Hline are
TEXT: H               used to compute the capacitor, diode,  BJT,  JFET,  and
TEXT: H               MOSFET  initial  conditions.   This  is  equivalent  to
TEXT: H               specifying the GICH=... parameter on  each  device  line,
TEXT: H               but  is much more convenient.  The GICH=... parameter can
TEXT: H               still be specified and will take  precedence  over  the
TEXT: H               G.IC Hvalues.  Since no dc bias (initial transient) solu-
TEXT: H               tion is computed before  the  transient  analysis,  one
TEXT: H               should  take  care to specify all dc source voltages on

TEXT: H               initial conditions.

TEXT: 
TEXT:      Gnutmeg Hcommands include constructs for looping, conditional

TEXT: H     cuted as scripts.  As a programming language it is quite

TEXT: H     with some sort of control statement, like _i_f, and end with
TEXT: H     the _e_n_d statement).  Because of GnutmegH's numeric orienta-

TEXT: H     Before it is read, however, the variables _a_r_g_c and _a_r_g_v are
TEXT: H     set to the number of words following the filename on the
TEXT: H     command line, and a list of those words respectively.  After
TEXT: H     the file is finished, these variables are GunsetH.  Note that
TEXT: H     if one command file calls another, it must save its _a_r_g_v and
TEXT: H     _a_r_g_c since they will be altered.  Also, command files should
TEXT: H     not be re-entrant since there are no local variables.  (Of
TEXT: H     course, the procedures may explicitly manipulate a global

TEXT: H     with G.control Hon it.  This is an unfortunate result of the
TEXT: H     Gsource Hcommand being used for both circuit input and command
TEXT: H     file execution.  Note also that this allows the user to
TEXT: H     merely type the name of a circuit file as a command, and it
TEXT: H     will be automatically loaded.

TEXT: H     where r and i are floating point (in %e format). Otherwise
TEXT: H     they are in %e format. Only one of _r_e_a_l and _c_o_m_p_l_e_x should
TEXT: H     appear.

TEXT:      The lines are guaranteed to be less than 80 columns wide
TEXT: H     (unless the plot title or variable names are very long, or a

TEXT: H     is safe to mail between systems that enforce 80 character
TEXT: H     lines.
TEXT: H
TEXT:      The binary format is similar to the ascii format in organi-
TEXT: H     zation, except that it is not readable (strings are NULL
TEXT: H     terminated instead of newline terminated) and the values are
TEXT: H     in the machine's double precision floating point format
TEXT: H     instead of in ascii.  This makes it much easier to read and
TEXT: H     write and makes the file smaller.
TEXT: H
TEXT:      The circuit title, date, and analysis type name in that
TEXT: H     order are at the start of the plot, each terminated by a
TEXT: H     NULL byte.  Then the flags field (a _s_h_o_r_t, which is 1 for
TEXT: H     real data and 2 for complex data), the number of outputs,
TEXT: H     and the number of points (both _i_n_t_e_g_e_rs) are present.  Fol-
TEXT: H     lowing this is a list of NULL-terminated strings which are
TEXT: H     command lines.  This list is terminated by an extra NULL
TEXT: H     byte.  Then come the options, which consist of the name,
TEXT: H     followed by the type and the value in binary.  The output
TEXT: H     "declarations" consist of the name, type code, flags, color,
TEXT: H     grid type, plot type, and dimension information in that
TEXT: H     order.  Next come the values, which are either doubles or
TEXT: H     pairs of doubles in the case of complex data.
TEXT: H
TEXT:      The old format (which is used by SPICE2 with the -r option)

TITLE: Variables
TEXT: 
TEXT:      There are many variables that have special meaning to the
TEXT: H     program.  (Note the difference between a _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e and a _v_e_c_-
TEXT: H     _t_o_r - a _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e is manipulated with the commands _s_e_t and

TEXT: H     notation.  A _v_e_c_t_o_r is a datum which can be plotted, manipu-
TEXT: H     lated algebraicly, and so forth.)
TEXT: H
TEXT:      A variable may also be set with the G.option Hline in the
TEXT: H     input file.  A variable set in this manner is not specific
TEXT: H     to the circuit it appears in, however.
TEXT: H
TEXT:      While any variable may be GsetH, only the following ones will
TEXT: H     have any significance to Gnutmeg Hor the simulator.  In addi-
