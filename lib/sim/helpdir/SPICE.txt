TITLE: SPICE3 Summary
TEXT: 
TEXT:                SPICE is a general-purpose circuit  simulation  program
TEXT: H          for  nonlinear  dc,  nonlinear transient, and linear ac ana-
TEXT: H          lyses.  Circuits may contain resistors,  capacitors,  induc-
TEXT: H          tors,  mutual  inductors,  independent  voltage  and current
TEXT: H          sources,  four  types  of  dependent  sources,  transmission
TEXT: H          lines, switches, and the five most common semiconductor dev-
TEXT: H          ices:  diodes, BJTs, JFETs, MESFETs, and MOSFETs.
TEXT: H
TEXT:                The SPICE3 version is based  directly  on  SPICE  2G.6.
TEXT: H          While  SPICE3 is being developed to include new features, it
TEXT: H          will continue to support those capabilities and models which
TEXT: H          remain in extensive use in the SPICE2 program.
TEXT: H
TEXT:                SPICE has built-in models for  the  semiconductor  dev-
TEXT: H          ices,  and  the  user  need specify only the pertinent model
TEXT: H          parameter values.  The model for the BJT  is  based  on  the
TEXT: H          integral  charge  model of Gummel and Poon;  however, if the
TEXT: H          Gummel- Poon parameters are not specified, the model reduces
TEXT: H          to  the  simpler  Ebers-Moll  model.  In either case, charge
TEXT: H          storage effects, ohmic resistances, and a  current-dependent
TEXT: H          output  conductance may be included.  The diode model can be
TEXT: H          used for either junction diodes or Schottky barrier  diodes.
TEXT: H          The  JFET  model  is  based on the FET model of Shichman and
TEXT: H          Hodges.   Four  MOSFET  models  are  implemented:  MOS1   is
TEXT: H          described  by a square-law I-V characteristic, MOS2[1] is an
TEXT: H          analytical model, while MOS3[1] is a  semi-empirical  model,
TEXT: H          and  MOS4[2,3] is the new BSIM (Berkeley Short-channel IGFET
TEXT: H          Model).  MOS2, MOS3, and MOS4 include  second-order  effects
TEXT: H          such  as channel length modulation, subthreshold conduction,
TEXT: H          scattering limited velocity saturation, small-size  effects,
TEXT: H          and charge-controlled capacitances.

TEXT:                The pole-zero analysis portion of  SPICE  computes  the
TEXT: H          poles and/or zeros in the small-signal ac transfer function.
TEXT: H          The program first computes the dc operating point  and  then
TEXT: H          determines  the  linearized, small-signal models for all the
TEXT: H          nonlinear devices in the circuit. This circuit is then  used
TEXT: H          to find the poles and zeros.
TEXT: H
TEXT:                Two types of transfer functions are allowed: one of the
TEXT: H          form  (output  voltage)/(input voltage) and the other of the
TEXT: H          form (output voltage)/(input current).  These two  types  of
TEXT: H          transfer  functions cover all the cases and one can find the

TEXT:                The use of an ideal element that is  highly  non-linear
TEXT: H          such as a switch can cause large discontinuities to occur in
TEXT: H          the circuit node voltages.  A  rapid  change  such  as  that
TEXT: H          associated  with a switch changing state can cause numerical
TEXT: H          roundoff or tolerance problems leading to erroneous  results
TEXT: H          or  timestep difficulties.  The user of switches can improve
TEXT: H          the situation by taking the following steps:
TEXT: H
TEXT:                First of all it is wise to set ideal switch  impedences
TEXT: H          only  high  and  low enough to be negligible with respect to
TEXT: H          other circuit elements.  Using switch  impedences  that  are
TEXT: H          close  to "ideal" in all cases will aggravate the problem of
TEXT: H          discontinuities mentioned above.  Of course,  when  modeling
TEXT: H          real  devices  such  as MOSFETS, the on resistance should be
TEXT: H          adjusted to a realistic level depending on the size  of  the
TEXT: H          device being modelled.
TEXT: H
TEXT:                If a wide range of ON to OFF resistance must be used in
TEXT: H          the switches (ROFF/RON >1e+12), then the tolerance on errors
TEXT: H          allowed during transient analysis  should  be  decreased  by
TEXT: H          using the G.OPTIONS Hline and specifying GTRTOL Hto be less than
TEXT: H          the default value of 7.0.  When switches are  placed  around
TEXT: H          capacitors,  then  the option GCHGTOL Hshould also be reduced.
TEXT: H          Suggested values for these two options  are  1.0  and  1e-16
TEXT: H          respectively.   These changes inform SPICE3 to be more care-

TITLE: Convergence
TEXT:

TEXT: H          lowing conditions hold:
TEXT: H
TEXT:           1)   The nonlinear branch  currents  converge  to  within  a
TEXT: H               tolerance  of  0.1  percent or 1 picoamp (1.0E-12 Amp),
TEXT: H               whichever is larger.

TEXT: H
TEXT:                Although the algorithm used in SPICE has been found  to

TEXT: H
TEXT:                Failure to converge in dc analysis is usually due to an
TEXT: H          error  in specifying circuit connections, element values, or
TEXT: H          model parameter values.  Regenerative switching circuits  or

TEXT:                The elements described to this point typically  require
TEXT: H          only  a  few  parameter values.  However, the models for the
TEXT: H          semiconductor devices that are included in the SPICE program
TEXT: H          require  many  parameter  values.   Often, many devices in a
TEXT: H          circuit are defined by the same set of device model  parame-
TEXT: H          ters.   For  these reasons, a set of device model parameters
TEXT: H          is defined on a separate G.MODEL Hline and assigned  a  unique
TEXT: H          model name.  The device element lines in SPICE then refer to
TEXT: H          the model name.  This scheme alleviates the need to  specify
TEXT: H          all of the model parameters on each device element line.
TEXT: H
TEXT:                Each device element line contains the device name,  the
TEXT: H          nodes to which the device is connected, and the device model

TEXT: H          than one stable state.  If a device is specified GOFFH, the dc
TEXT: H          operating point is determined with the terminal voltages for
TEXT: H          that device set to zero.  After convergence is obtained, the
TEXT: H          program continues to iterate to obtain the exact  value  for
TEXT: H          the  terminal  voltages.   If a circuit has more than one dc
TEXT: H          stable state, the GOFF Hoption can be used to force the  solu-
TEXT: H          tion  to  correspond  to  a  desired  state.  If a device is
TEXT: H          specified GOFF Hwhen in reality the device is conducting,  the
TEXT: H          program will still obtain the correct solution (assuming the
TEXT: H          solutions converge) but more  iterations  will  be  required
TEXT: H          since   the  program  must  independently  converge  to  two
